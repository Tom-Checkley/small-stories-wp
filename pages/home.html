		Everyone has a story to tell, but not everyone has the opportunity to tell it. The most interesting stories tell the truth. But in a world of noise and distraction, where charity funding is cut and self-promotion and marketing are key, many of the really interesting stories get drowned out.
	</p>
	<h3>That's where Small Stories comes in.</h3>
	<p>
		We aim to give charities and the people they serve a voice. Our audiences can enjoy and evening of honest, interesting and important stories that may otherwise go unheard. The people who need to tell those stories get to have their say, and hard working charities who can help them get to spread their word for free.
	</p>
	<h3>What could be better than that?</h3>
	<p>
		We’re all about creativity, but with honesty and purpose. If you want to know <a href="">who’s in charge</a> here, <a href="">why we set up</a>, or <a href="">how to get in touch</a>, go ahead. We’d love to have you as a part of Small Stories.
