		Our first event on Sunday September 11th at The Lantern, Colston Hall will raise funds for free counselling service, The Harbour.
	</p>
	<h3>About The Harbour</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="">The Harbour</a> provides professional counselling, free of charge, to people affected by life-threatening illness. This includes people with an illness, their carers and loved ones, and people who have been bereaved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of the people they have supported will tell you their story at the event.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are no fees for our services; we cover the costs of the sessions through fundraising activities and grants from our partners such as Bristol CCG, Macmillan, local grant-makers, and individual donors.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our vision is that everyone in Bristol has access to high quality counselling to support them with the emotional pain that comes with life-threatening illness.
	</p>
	<p>
		We support around 300 people each year through 1:1 counselling, couples counselling, and group therapy.
